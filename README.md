# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

  In this project, I developed a real-time anomaly detection system that monitors a continuous data stream. I utilized a combination of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Z-score calculations to effectively identify anomalies while minimizing false positives. The system simulates data with seasonality, noise, and drift, allowing for dynamic analysis. With visualizations and robust error handling, this tool is designed for efficient real-time monitoring. My goal is to enhance the detection of anomalies in various applications, providing valuable insights into data behavior.
